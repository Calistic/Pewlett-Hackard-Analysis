# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Summary of the Results

### Number of individuals retiring:
- 4,0975 employees set to retire (born between 1952 and 1956)

### Number of individuals being hired:
- This is assumed to be the same amount as people retiring, 4,0975.

### Number of individuals available for mentorship role:
- 1,549 current employees born in 1965

### One recommendation for further analysis on this data set:
- It would be smart to further filter the mentor list by department. This would help to ensure that mentors and mentees are from the same department (ie prevent finance employees from mentoring engineers).

### PART 1B
I'm unclear what is wanted here so I'm showing two tables. The first shows the retireee totals for each department. The second is a list of all retirees, their current and past posistions.
